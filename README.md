Autodomet 🚗⛽
Autodomet is a Python application that allows you to calculate how far you can travel with the fuel you have. The program asks you to enter:

Car brand
Car model
Fuel amount (in liters)
Distance already driven (in kilometers)
It then calculates the remaining distance you can travel with the given fuel.
